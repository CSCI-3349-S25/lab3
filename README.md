# Lab 3: Building your own n-gram model

In this lab, you'll building your own n-gram model which you can use to generate text and to evaluate the probability of a text.

The lab will be entirely contained within a [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WGYCkZ_6kwDLtNs6eXBriDEjSJi4v5vu?usp=sharing). 

### Overview 
1. Clone the lab repo down to your own machine. [Here's a link to detailed directions for doing this with GitHub Desktop and with git from the command line](https://github.com/CSCI-3349-S25/git-instructions). 
2. Complete the lab in the Colab notebook, as described below in Parts 1 and 2. 
3. Share your Colab notebook with me and the TAs, as described in the notebook.
4. Download, add, commit, and push your notebook to your repo. 


### Part 1: Getting your own copy of the Colab notebook.

[Here's a link to the Colab notebook for lab 2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WGYCkZ_6kwDLtNs6eXBriDEjSJi4v5vu?usp=sharing). Remember you need to save a copy in your drive to start editing!


### Part 2: Complete the Colab notebook
* Follow the instructions in the [Colab notebook for Lab 3](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WGYCkZ_6kwDLtNs6eXBriDEjSJi4v5vu?usp=sharing) to create your own copy of the notebook.
* Edit the Colab notebook to complete the various tasks, as indicated in the notebook. Most of the time this will involve writing code in a code cell, but sometimes you will answer questions in a text cell. It will always be clear what you have to do.
* When your notebook is complete, you will share the notebook with me and the TAs, as decribed in the notebook.

### Part 3: Submit your work

* Download your Colab notebook to your computer, move it into this repository, and add, commit, and push it to GitHub, just like you did for Lab 1 and Lab 2.
* **Do not alter the Colab notebook after the deadline.** If you do -- even just to fix a typo! -- it will look like you turned the notebook in late.
